# Samurai Run – Endless 3D Runner
##CG Final Project

Made this game for Computer Graphics final project. 

##Game Play

In Samurai Run, the player controls the Samurai, a warrior who has destroyed a sacred temple, unfortunately he did not realize that the temple was cursed and now the whole trail is being destroyed. As the game is an endless running game, there is no end to the trail; therefore, the player plays until the character falls off the trail or collides with the burning obstacles and burns alive.

The game starts off with the player running for his life and consistently increases the difficulty of the game by a rise in speed. The Samurai has an animation associated with it and hitting any obstacles or falling off the trail would result in its death. The setting is that the Samurai is running while the trail is on fire and burning down. Slowing down is not an option.
